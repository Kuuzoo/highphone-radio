# HighPhone Custom Radio App

### Small Information:
> This is just an old project of mine, and I now wanted to release it to the public because I didn't know what to do with it.

### How to add:
> You basically just drag and drop the files into the correct folder.
> For files like config.js just paste the application into the Config.Applications object.
> And for the radio js, place it into the javascript app folder.

### Problems and Bugs:
> If you have any bugs or problems with the app, I will not provide support for it.
